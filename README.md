# Netflix-Clone
This project is a responsive Netflix Clone built using HTML and CSS. The design replicates the core user interface of Netflix, including the header, movie/series thumbnails, and footer. It serves as a great practice project for mastering basic web design techniques, including layout structuring, Flexbox, and grid systems.
